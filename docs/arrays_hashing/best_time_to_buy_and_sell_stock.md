# 2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        for price in prices:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            elif price - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price
        return max_profit
```

## Explanation

The solution iterates through the `prices` array, keeping track of the minimum price seen so far (`min_price`) and the maximum profit found (`max_profit`).

For each price, we first check if it's a new minimum price. If it is, we update `min_price`.

Otherwise, we calculate the potential profit by subtracting the `min_price` from the current price. If this potential profit is greater than our current `max_profit`, we update `max_profit`.

This single-pass approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
